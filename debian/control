Description: Organizer for /usr/local software packages
 GNU Stow is a software installation manager for /usr/local.  Using
 symbolic links, GNU Stow helps you keep the installations separate
 (/usr/local/stow/emacs vs. /usr/local/stow/perl, for example) while
 maintaining the illusion that they are all under /usr/local.
